# ThreatModelingGame

## Description
The Elevation of Privilege (EoP) Card Game for remote teams.
The [original game](http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/adopt/eop.aspx) has been created by Microsoft and is given away by Microsoft at trade shows or other events and as a [PDF download](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20303) of the Adobe Illustrator source files.

The game is designed to draw people who are not security practitioners into the craft of threat modeling. The game uses a variety of techniques to do so in an enticing, supportive and non-threatening way.

For more information I recommend to read [Microsoft's whitepaper](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/A/E/FAE1434F-6D22-4581-9804-8B60C04354E4/EoP_Whitepaper.pdf).

## About this project

### Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to provide remote teams a way to deal the cards and play the game in an online meeting (Lync, Skype, Google Hangouts, whatever you are using in your company!).

In the first version I am focusing on providing a way of dealing the cards over the wire. The other aspects of the game, like modeling the system and writing down the bugs, can already be easily achieved with other online tools like Microsoft Office 365, Google Docs, etc.

In later versions I might be looking to embed support for other 3rd party tools into the UI.

Additionally I would like to support multilingual translations in the online version!

### Status
This project is still in work.

### Hosting
Currently it is hosted on Windows Azure and is available at http://threat-modeling-game.azurewebsites.net/
